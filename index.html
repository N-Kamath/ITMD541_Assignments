                I'm a student in the ITMD 541 course, passionate about web technologies and its incredible potential to 
                transform and improve experiences worldwide. My web experience includes designing websites using HTML, CSS,
                and basics of JavaScript along with a bit of PHP and MySQL.
                I aspire to leverage my comprehensive understanding of web technologies,
                developed through academic training, practical experiences, and ongoing self-learning, 
                to excel in this course and beyond.
