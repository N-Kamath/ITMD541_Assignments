		I'd like to introduce myself as Navaneeth Kamath, and I'm excited to provide you with an overview of my GitHub repository, which goes by the name of "ITMD541_Assignments." 
		My professional background predominantly revolves around the field of Database Administration, and I've honed my skills in various areas such as SQL and bash scripting.
		While my expertise lies in database management, I also possess a basic understanding of web application development. Specifically, I have experience in creating static 
		webpages using fundamental technologies like HTML and CSS. Although my proficiency in this domain is still developing, I'm eager to further develop my expertise and capabilities 
		as this semester progresses.
