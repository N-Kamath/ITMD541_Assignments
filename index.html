                Hi, I'm Navaneeth Kamath, and I want to introduce you to my web bio page. I'm excited to share a bit about myself and my journey in the world of web development.

                 My love for technology led me to work in Database Administration, where I've spent a lot of time getting better at things like SQL and bash scripting. While I'm good at databases, my curiosity and desire to learn led me to try out web development.

                 I've recently started learning web development, beginning with the basics of HTML and CSS. I've had the chance to create simple webpages and get a basic understanding of the important technologies that make the web work. Though I'm still learning about web development, I'm eager to expand my knowledge as this semester goes on.

                    In the course ITMD 541 - Web Application Foundation, I'll enhance my existing knowledge by building a strong web development foundation. This includes web protocols, architectures, scripting, and mastering JavaScript for interactive user interfaces. I'll also explore key web development libraries and tools to further advance my skills.
