                    Hi, I'm Navaneeth Kamath, and I'd like to welcome you to my web bio page. I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself and my journey in the world of web development.

                    My passion for technology led me to a career in Database Administration, where I've spent significant time fine-tuning my skills in areas such as SQL and bash scripting. While databases are my forte, my curiosity and desire for growth led me to explore web development.

                    I've recently begun my journey into web development, beginning with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I've had the opportunity to build static webpages and gain a foundational understanding of the essential technologies that drive the web. Although I'm still on the learning curve in web development, I'm eager to expand my expertise and capabilities as this semester progresses.

                    In the course ITMD 541 - Web Application Foundation, I'll enhance my existing knowledge by building a strong web development foundation. This includes web protocols, architectures, scripting, and mastering JavaScript for interactive user interfaces. I'll also explore key web development libraries and tools to further advance my skills.
